[["null-distribution.html", "Chapter 2 NULL distribution 2.1 Relationship of null hypothesis and p value", " Chapter 2 NULL distribution In statistics, a null distribution refers to the distribution of a test statistic under the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no difference or no relationship between two variables. The null distribution represents the expected distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true. It is used to assess the probability of obtaining the observed test statistic by chance alone and to calculate a p-value. In bioinformatics, null distributions are commonly used to assess the significance of observed results, such as the differential expression of genes between two conditions or the enrichment of certain gene sets in a particular pathway. For example, in a gene expression analysis, the null hypothesis may be that the expression levels of genes are not different between two groups of samples. A null distribution can be built by simulating the expected distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis using randomization or permutation tests. To build a null distribution, the following steps can be taken: Define the null hypothesis: This is a statement that assumes there is no difference or relationship between the variables being tested. Choose a test statistic: The test statistic should be chosen to measure the difference or relationship between the variables. Generate the null distribution: This can be done by randomly permuting or shuffling the labels or values of the variables being tested. For example, in a gene expression analysis, the labels of the samples can be randomly permuted to create a null distribution of differential expression values. Calculate the test statistic for each permutation: The test statistic should be calculated for each permutation or shuffle to generate the null distribution. Assess the significance: The significance of the observed test statistic can be assessed by comparing it to the null distribution and calculating a p-value. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the observed value if the null hypothesis is true. Overall, null distributions are an important tool in bioinformatics for assessing the significance of observed results and for making statistical inferences about biological processes. Suppose we have conducted a gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes between two groups of samples, A and B. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in gene expression between the two groups. We can test this hypothesis by using a permutation test to generate a null distribution of differential expression values. Define the null hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in gene expression between groups A and B. Choose a test statistic: We can use the log2 fold change between groups A and B as the test statistic. This measures the difference in gene expression between the two groups. Generate the null distribution: We can generate a null distribution by randomly permuting the labels of the samples between groups A and B. For each permutation, we can calculate the log2 fold change for each gene. Calculate the test statistic for each permutation: We can calculate the log2 fold change for each gene for each permutation to generate a null distribution of log2 fold changes. Assess the significance: We can assess the significance of the observed log2 fold change by comparing it to the null distribution and calculating a p-value. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a log2 fold change as extreme as the observed value if the null hypothesis is true. For example, suppose we observe a log2 fold change of 2 for a particular gene. We can generate a null distribution of log2 fold changes by permuting the sample labels and calculating the log2 fold change for each gene. Suppose the null distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. We can calculate a p-value by determining the proportion of null distribution values that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed log2 fold change of 2. If this proportion is less than a predetermined significance level, such as 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the gene is differentially expressed between groups A and B. 2.1 Relationship of null hypothesis and p value The null hypothesis and p-value are two important concepts in statistical hypothesis testing, where we aim to determine whether an observed effect or result is statistically significant or not. The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant difference between two groups or variables. It’s often denoted as H0, and it’s the default assumption until proven otherwise. The p-value, on the other hand, is the probability of observing a result as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the likelihood of obtaining the observed result by chance alone, assuming that there is no real difference between the groups or variables being compared. If the p-value is very small (typically less than 0.05 or 0.01), then it’s unlikely that the observed result occurred by chance alone, and we reject the null hypothesis. In contrast, if the p-value is relatively large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference between the groups or variables being compared. Therefore, the p-value provides a way to quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis. It tells us how likely the observed result would be if the null hypothesis were true. If this likelihood is very low, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed result is statistically significant.
