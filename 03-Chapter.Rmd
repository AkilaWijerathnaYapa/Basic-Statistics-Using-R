# Types of Null Distributions

In statistics, the null distribution refers to the distribution of a test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Different types of null distributions are used depending on the characteristics of the data and the test being performed. Here are some common types of null distributions:

Normal distribution: The normal distribution is often used when the sample size is large enough to satisfy the Central Limit Theorem. Many commonly used tests, such as the t-test, F-test, and chi-squared test, assume a normal null distribution.

Student's t-distribution: The t-distribution is used when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution, which accounts for the increased variability due to the smaller sample size.

F-distribution: The F-distribution is used in ANOVA (analysis of variance) and other tests that compare variances. It is the ratio of two chi-squared distributions divided by their degrees of freedom.

Chi-squared distribution: The chi-squared distribution is used in tests of independence, goodness of fit, and homogeneity. It is the sum of squared deviations of observed values from their expected values divided by the expected values.

Binomial distribution: The binomial distribution is used in tests of proportions and for count data. It models the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.

Poisson distribution: The Poisson distribution is used for count data that follow a rare event occurrence, such as the number of accidents in a day or the number of customers arriving at a store.

These are just a few examples of the types of null distributions used in statistical tests. The choice of the appropriate null distribution depends on the nature of the data and the hypothesis being tested.
